# Assessment 2 Front-End Theme

In this project, our goal was to collaboratively design and develop a theme for a website utilising Tailwind CSS and Wordpress. Working in our small group, with our group consisting of Bryn Sinstead-Reid, Euan Todd, and Rey Berkelmans, we will be leveraging content from the current Canberra Modern site to create a visually appealing and functional responsive website using Local, Wordpress, and Github.

# Individual Contribution

Throughout the development of this project, our team each contributed their skills and perspectives to develop our Canberra Modern Wordpress theme.

## Euan Todd

Euan’s task during the assessment was to lead the group in coding the template. He used his knowledge and skills in web development to contribute constant additions of new code and revisions to existing code and was highly communicative around developing our site template.

At the beginning of the project, Euan was inexperienced in Tailwind CSS and Wordpress. While this new approach to web development was difficult at first, he worked hard to study the documentation and used Tailwind CSS to effectively construct parts of the site template.

## Rey Berkelmans

Rey’s tasks were assisting in development and the coding of the template, giving suggestions and feedback, as well as writing additional content and documentation for the project, providing critical feedback and communicating in group discussions. 

While Rey wasn’t very confident in his coding ability in Tailwind CSS, working through the task with the team and referring to the documentation helped him improve his skills in the framework, which helped him contribute meaningful changes to the site template.

## Bryn Sinstead-Reid

Bryn’s tasks were providing assistance in coding the template, creating the design for our redesigned page, providing images and assets such as the logo and site images, and assisting in writing additional content and documentation.

Bryn was unfamiliar with Wordpress, Tailwind, and integrating with Github, and found the task daunting at first. Throughout the project he worked through these challenges and was eventually able to work with all three comfortably, pushing changes through Github confidently.

# Issue Resolution

Throughout the development of this project, our team encountered several challenges, requiring us to address these challenges and find solutions for them.

Our group’s first major challenge was difficulty interpreting instructions about how to install the necessary files to give us the ability to edit and design the template. These instructions only worked for MacOS, and therefore did not work for some members of the group. This resulted in a delay before we could begin working on the template until the instructions were updated and we were able to receive additional assistance. During this time, we looked at the design of the Wordpress template and how we might be able to alter it, not wanting our time to be wasted while waiting on assistance. 

Once we received the necessary fixes to these necessary instructions allowing us to begin our work, we began the development of the template.

While our team wasn't experienced with Tailwind CSS or Wordpress, we worked together to parse the code of the template and find ways to modify it beyond what was originally provided.

An example of where we had struggled was with the application of a logo in the header. We took a step back and discussed why this issue was occurring. By looking through Wordpress documentation, receiving tutor feedback, and cooperating with each other, we were able to determine a Wordpress function that would allow us to display a header logo.

The second biggest challenge we encountered while developing the template was making the layout and design responsive while working within the boundaries and limitations of Tailwind CSS and Wordpress. We had to find ways to make our navigation functional on smaller displays. This was initially a difficult concept to tackle as we found the navigation links were nested under hover interactions. Through discussion and research, we were able to discover a method of hiding and unhiding unique mobile-only navigation bars through the use of the ‘hidden’ Tailwind tag.

# Team Collaboration

During the development of our team worked effectively and collaborated closely throughout each step of the project. We worked almost daily on the project and informed each other of developments and changes. 

When we were stumped or unable to progress, we found ourselves able to find assistance in the group’s knowledge, and used the resources at our disposal to help guide each other through challenges.

Our group’s distribution of tasks was even, and we made constant adjustments and considerations for each member of the group.

Through communication and team-oriented workflow, we implemented a successful design solution for our site template theme, and our group has finished the project understanding more about successful construction of websites in Wordpress and Tailwind, and collaboration in a programming and design-oriented project.
