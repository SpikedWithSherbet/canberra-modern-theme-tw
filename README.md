# Assessment 2: Front-End Theme

In this project, our goal was to collaboratively design and develop a theme for a website utilising Tailwind CSS and Wordpress. Working in our small group, with our group consisting of Bryn, Euan Todd, and Rey Berkelmans, we will be leveraging content from the current Canberra Modern site to create a visually appealing and functional responsive website using Local, Wordpress, and Github.

There are multiple issues with the current Canberra Modern’s site and design that our new design will work to change and improve upon.

The main flaws for the Canberra Modern’s current site and design include:

1. Busy Navigation.
2. Overly-Complicated Code.
3. Poor Logo Design.
4. Poor Colour Choices.
5. Inaccessible Account System.

However, the current site and design does additionally have some positives, including:

1. Clear Overall Design.
2. Use of Negative Space.
4. Informative.
5. Functional.

Style and design is an important aspect of website development, as it directly impacts a users experience on the site, therefore it is very important to work towards creating a well thought-out style and design.

If a site has poor style and design, it can negatively impact a user’s experience, which leaves behind a negative impression, along with causing unnecessary confusion and stress. This results in users avoiding accessing a specific site in the future, along with recommending other potential users to avoid the site.

# Improvements

We can now consider what improvements we make for this site and its design.

## Code

Instead of utilising Wix’s unnecessary complicated and confusing code, we will aim towards utilising Tailwind CSS, which will assist in keeping code tidy. This additionally allows us to work towards making the website responsive along with the code being easier to read.

## Layout

To improve the site’s layout, we aim to condense the design down to the basic elements, adding relevant sections where needed. Additionally, we aim to create a footer which is more condensed down in order to prevent it from being invasive amongst the page layout.

## Logo

We also aim to redesign the brand identity of Canberra Modern, which involves redesigning a new logo. This new logo combines the modernist architectural styles of Canberra Modern with typography to create an angular logo which will take advantage of negative space, along with being clear and easy to read and understand.

## Colour Palette

We looked towards creating a colour palette to create a simple design aesthetic, as opposed to the inconsistent palette of the current site. The high contrast colour palette we created to increase screen compatibility, accessibility, and the design quality of the site. The white and black provides high contrast for a vast array of different screens, while the teal amplifies key sections of the site with colour.

## Navigation

In our redesigned navigation, we aim towards making the navigation clear and understandable to an average user, which will assist in preventing users from becoming overwhelmed while navigating this site. One way we can do this is by combining or removing separate pages.

# Development

After considering the design we wish to aim towards with the new site’s design, we can begin development of the new site. However, we did face issues while developing this site.

Before we began, we created a group chat for communication and collaboration with each other over the internet, even while we weren’t working with each other in-person.

Soon after, our group faced the first major issue, resulting from unclear instructions about how to install the necessary files to give us the ability to edit and design this site. These instructions only worked for specific types of computers, and therefore did not work for some members of the group. This resulted in a delay before we could begin working on the site until the instructions were updated and we got additional assistance.

After this, we began development of the site, but discovered some issues, including:

1. Inability to edit most of the content that was located in Wordpress.
2. None of our members had much experience using Tailwind CSS and Wordpress.
3. Difficulty changing specific sections of the site.

Additionally, during the development of this site, there were times where we had to wait until we got additional assistance from a tutorial to fix certain issues or questions we had about the code. This slowed down the overall development of the site.

One issue we encountered while developing this site was with making this site responsive, especially due to the limitations of Tailwind CSS and Wordpress. However, utilising Media Queries, and resizing aspects, we were able to successfully get the site responsive.

# Final Thoughts

Overall, our group did successfully complete our goal to collaboratively design and develop a theme for a website using Tailwind CSS and Wordpress. We were able to leverage content from the current Canberra Modern site to create a visually appealing and functional responsive website utilising Local, Wordpress, and Github.
